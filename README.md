# Assignment Name

Software Major 1

## Project Name

Mail-IT

# Description
This assignment was written in Python with the assitance of these libraries:
  - Kivy
  - pandas
  - tkinter
  - re

The goal of this project was to create a alert system for a school. The current system when this project was created was that the office ladies would go through and call all the parents
of the students that were marked as late. This is a very slow and intricate process which takes a lot of time. Hence a system which automated this process would allow the office ladies to work on more
important tasks. 

##Software Development Approaches and Tools
During the development of this project i had utilised libraries that worked with python to allow me to communicate with the google mail servers as well as the phone network to be able
to send emails and messages automatically. The approach that was taken in this assignment was an agile approach which allowed me to build several versions of the code and see it work.
